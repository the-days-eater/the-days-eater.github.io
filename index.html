        <h2>WHY NFTS?</h2>
        <p>As a new, decentralized art form, NFTs are making art-making
            more accessible to anyone with enough money to mint one. 
            Because of how much energy is necessary to so,
            and because of the hype around blockchain tech, some
            NFTs have sold for millions of dollars. With NFTs, small
            artists have a chance to finally get rich quick - so naturally,
            most people who mint NFTs are not artists, and NFTs have
            a reputation for being aesthetically unpleasant. They're usually made of
            copy-pasted assets, are procedurally generated, or use stolen art, since you 
            can mint any digital work on the Internet, even if it's not your own. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row fadein">
        <h2>WHAT DOES IT COST?</h2>
        <p>An analysis of 18,000 NFTs showed that the “average NFT
            has a carbon footprint… equivalent to more than a month’s worth
            of electricity for a person living in the EU.” This is due to the 
           nature of cryptocurrency mining, specifically for Ethereum,
            which is the currency exchanged in most major NFT marketplaces: 
           “[t]o keep financial records secure, the system forces people to 
           solve complex puzzles using energy-guzzling machines.” 
           For every mined crypto token, the cost of mining the next
            increases; if you have been unable to purchase
           a graphics card recently, chances are it’s due to blockchain
           enthusiasts buying out GPUs to feed their money-making
           machine factories. Also, artists have made their art accounts private 
           or deleted them altogether to avoid having their work stolen.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row fadein">
        <h2>WHAT IS IT WORTH?</h2>
        <p>Some NFTs have sold for millions, but their popularity is 
            decreasing the more people realize that they’re not
            actually worth anything - an NFT is not an original copy of
            a digital work, but a link to a digital receipt 
            that can be deleted or changed at any time. They’ve been used
            as a way to launder money and scam those looking to invest
            in new tech, though. Since the majority of NFTs are made in bulk, 
        they're not only ugly but devoid of life or meaning, like a weird form of hypercapitalist anti-art.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row fadein">
        <h2>WHO DOES IT BENEFIT?</h2>
        <p>The people into NFTs tend to be white men with enough money or means to invest
            in them. A big reason the internet was so novel and freeing when it was first 
            created is that users
            were anonymous; it was a place where you weren't judged by your real-life status, 
            wealth, or identity. When people shared their art, they did it to bond with others.
             But much of the NFT craze is about using your collections of hyper-expensive 
            clipart to show off your wealth (twitter, for example,
            changes the shape of your profile picture if it's an NFT), essentially bringing in the passing-around
            of capital between investors that plagues the fine art world today into the digital scene. It's a profitable 
            way to reproduce existing socioeconomic divisions in a space where they were not meant to exist.
