        <h2>WHY NFTS?</h2>
        <p>As a new, decentralized art form, NFTs are making art-making
            more accessible to anyone with enough money to mint one. 
            Because of how much energy is necessary to mint an
            NFT, and because of the hype around blockchain tech, some
            NFTs have sold for millions of dollars. With NFTs, small
            artists have a chance to finally get rich quick - so naturally,
            most people who mint NFTs are not artists, and NFTs have
            a reputation for being aesthetically unpleasant. Even better, 
            you can mint an NFT of any digital work on the internet, even if 
            you do not own the rights to it.  </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row fadein">
        <h2>WHAT DOES IT COST?</h2>
        <p>An analysis of 18,000 NFTs showed that the “average NFT
            has a carbon footprint… equivalent to more than a month’s worth
            of electricity for a person living in the EU.” This is due to the 
           nature of cryptocurrency mining, specifically for Ethereum,
            which is the currency exchanged in most major NFT marketplaces: 
           “[t]o keep financial records secure, the system forces people to 
           solve complex puzzles using energy-guzzling machines.” 
           For every mined crypto token, the cost of mining the next
            increases; if you have been unable to purchase
           a graphics card recently, chances are it’s due to blockchain
           enthusiasts buying out GPUs to feed their money-making
           machines. Also, artists have made their art accounts private 
           or deleted them altogether to avoid having their work stolen.</p>

    <div class="row fadein">
        <h2>WHAT IS IT WORTH?</h2>
        <p>Some NFTs have sold for millions, but their popularity is 
            decreasing the more people realize that they’re not
            actually worth anything - an NFT is not an original copy of
            a digital work, but a link to a digital receipt 
            that can be deleted or changed at any time. They’ve been used
            as a way to launder money and scam those looking to invest
            in new tech, though. </p>
