  <div id="about-text">hello! if you're reading this, it's not too late. i hope this informational web page,
      created for art 8, can convince you to look beyond shiny tech ads and cash-grabs. anything can be 
      called "innovational," but we as students have a responsibility to consider who profits from new technologies
      and at what expense.
